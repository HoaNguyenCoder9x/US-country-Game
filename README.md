# US-country-Game
Today, I have learnt about pandas and list comprehensive, so based on Angela Yu mention, I make this game. Hope you enjoy!
The mission of the game is you have to fill out the name of 50 countries in US. If not, you can write 'exit', then the other country name - which you don't remember in learn_file.txt for you to learn.

P/s: the idea come from Angela Yu course
